# MentionText

This is a simple composable that allows the user to mention users and insert the mentions in the middle of the text. There's a simple Mention Source filled with dummy data but normally, this data would be paginated from the backed. There's also search functionality based on the changing value of the two words after the cursor spearated by a space.
